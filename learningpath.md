# About This Page

I created this page to follow the online courses I have completed and to plan my future online learning process. There are two main reasons why I should share this information that I had previously checked on Trello. The first one is to create a road map for my colleagues, who we are heading towards the same goal but who have set out after me. The second is being accountable to myself by sharing my goals with world.
