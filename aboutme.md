Also, I am very fond of cinema, big fan of Martin Scorsese and Yavuz Turgul. I love to create digital art and play around with my Illustrator skills, apart from these I love listening to music from different genres. I am eager to meet new people, to connect, discuss, network and grow, mostly at conferences, meet-ups and bus-stops.
