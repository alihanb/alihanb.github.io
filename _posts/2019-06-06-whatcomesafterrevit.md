### What happened to Quantum? What is Autodesk's approach to the future of cloud-based BIM?

While I'm searching something else, I saw that [interview with Jim Awe, Chief Software Architect of Autodesk](https://aecmag.com/technology-mainmenu-35/1821-beyond-revit-autodesk-seeks-to-reinvent-collaborative-bim). I think it's a little long to read but it's worth it. 

#### My thoughts on this topics and the interview

I was wondering for long time what happened to Project Quantum. Learned that it evolved to Project Plasma with more data-centric approach. Especially the idea of using blockchain for using logging the data transfers and changes excited me. Blockchain can add value our projects with its high degree of trust, transparency and traceability. 

I think centering the data is important because current tools is not effective for managing the "Information" part of BIM. Cool design tools that we have, made big impact in our industry in last years. But now, designing in Revit faster, smarter and collaboratively is "the new normal" . We need go forward with managing the data that we will create and the processes how to use it effectively. 

Future is coming. What you think about it?
