## About Design Together

Design Together with Building Information Modelling is a student competition organized by ITU-MHK. Their purpose is to raise awareness of the BIM in student comunity. Teams which contains civil and mechanical engineers and architects creates projects with the scope of Competition Specification. In <a target="_blank" href="http://en.designtogether.itumhk.com/2019-design-together-projects/">2019</a>, 29 teams completed projects and 11 teams qualified for the final.

## About Our Team and Our Project

We participated in the competition as 3 architects, 2 civil engineers, and 1 mechanical engineer. Our biggest challenge was communication because each of us was in different cities during the project. It took us a long time to solve this problem, but after we solved it, our project processes went faster than we expected. 
<br>
I think all of the team has done great work. Bing√ºl managed the all architecture design processes and prepared sustainability report. Elif created all Revit families and designed cool parametric furniture. Mina prepared renders and animation like a professional. Emrah made the structural analysis of the project and designed every rebar in the project as 3D. Harun designed plumbing and fire safety systems. I lead preparing BEP, decided which software and which standards that we use in the project and worked on coordination and 4D simulation.
<br>
As a result, we took 3rd place after the jury evaluation. It was a great pleasure for us. We learned and experienced lots of things in this process.
